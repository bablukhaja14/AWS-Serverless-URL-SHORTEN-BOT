Architectural Flow:

If the user Enters a very long URL then you need to return a very short URL, you can use this specific CleanUri API. You would call this API using Python code that is running in Lambda, then shorten the user-shared URL. Once you receive the response, you would push it from Lambda to our Telegram server, where the user could obtain the short format of the URL.
